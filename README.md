# STA130

The final group project for my STA130 course. Consists of comprehensive data analysis using statistical techniques (e.g. simulation, bootstrapping, hypothesis testing) and visualisation of data using R (and a number of its associated packages) related to story elements in detective novels written between the 1800s-1900s.
